"""Tasks executing via ssh and sh.

Factory provides api for local and nonlocal running of functions,scripts, etc via ssh and sh.
It is proof-of-concept realization of [fabric](https://github.com/fabric/fabric) with a number of differences:
* run() function works in the same way with subprocess.popen under localhost as under ssh connect to remote host
* Factory uses openssh or any another ssh client (you should modified config for this), so you can use all power of ssh sockets
* Factory uses [gevent](https://github.com/surfly/gevent) library for asynchronous executing

Example:
  $ ./factory.py 'echo "hello, world!"'
  $ ./factory.py --host user@host:port run:'uname -a'
